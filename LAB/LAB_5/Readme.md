## ClassConcepts and Hashing
- Write a Class that has an array in it. Initialize the array via a constructor during objectcreation.  Write a member function to sort the array. Write linear and binary search(iterative andrecursive) as member functions of the class and calculate the experimental time taken for linearand binary search on array of various sizes.
- Write a Class which has an array of integers. Write various Hash Compression Mapsdiscussed in the lecture as the member functions of the Class. The member functions musthash all the values in the arrays to the hash table(array) using the define compression logic
- WAP to demonstrate the working of separate chaining during a collision in Hashing. Use anarray and a compression map and show how separate chaining will work in collisionscenarios

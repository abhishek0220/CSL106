## ClassConcepts and Hashing
- Write a Class to implement Quick Sort, Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. Throughexperimental evaluation check how much time these sorting algorithms take on best andworst case inputs and of varying sizes. Do you see anything that you can correlate withtheory you studied in class
- Write a Class to do linear time sorting using Counting Sort and Bucket Sort. Also implementRadix sort using Counting sort. Compare experimental time taken with comparison basedsorting algorithms. What did you observe?
- Write a class Complex having real and imaginary as data members. Overload +, - operators.Can you also overload << operator so that output of the object gets printed in your customformat while using cout?

# Assignment 1: CSL 106       
Evaluation : 5 Marks  
Last Date of Submission: 8th October IST <br/>
Submission type: Online via LMS as a Zipped Folder (FullName_RollNumber_Assignment1 should be the name of your zipped folder) <br/>
Plagiarism rules: If content is found plagiarised all parties will get 0 marks.  <br/>
Note: Every solution must have sufficient comments in the source code and the algorithm must be written in such a way that it should take minimum running time and space.  <br/>
Do Any 5 (For problems from 1 to 7). Do any two (For problems from 8 to 10) Do any one (From problem 11,12)     
<ol>
<li>WAP to perform merge sort on singly linked list.</li>
<li>WAP to group anagrams together from an arbitrary given list of words. Two words are anagrams of each other if one can be obtained from the other by rearranging the letters in other one but only exactly once. CARS and ARCS are anagrams.</li>
<li>4 sum problem: In an unsorted array of integers check if it contains any four elements having a given sum. Find all such 4 elements tuples and print them.</li>
<li>Sort elements by their frequency in an array(one element may have repeated instances). High frequency element in an array should come first. If the frequency of two elements is same then whoever has lower index presence should have all its instance come first in the sorted array. </li>
<li>Maximum Subarray Problem: Given an array of integers find a contiguous subarray of the array which has the largest sum.</li> 
<li>Check if one String can be derived from another String by circularly (clockwise or anti clockwise) rotating the other string. </li>
<li>Can you write a randomized version of quick sort such that pivot is not the rightmost element of the given array. Why would someone want to write a randomized quick sort algorithm ?</li>
<li>Discuss best case, worst case and average case of bucket sort with respect to the running time. Explain the assumptions taken if any.</li>
<li>Take a source code file as an input and parse it through stack to see if the brackets of different types have been opened and closed properly.</li>
<li> Discuss the running times of linear probing, quadratic probing and double hashing in terms of search, insertion and deletion operations. </li>
<li> Write a program to visualize the working of any one sorting algorithm discussed in the class. You can also use any tool to make a short video (desktop video or ppt animation recording) to explain how an array gets sorted through steps of a specific sorting algorithm. </li>
<li>Create a video to explain any data structure concept through a presentation in your own words. It should not be more than 5 minutes video. Use your own creative skills to create online learning content on the topic to present a concept effectively to an audience. </li>
  </ol>
